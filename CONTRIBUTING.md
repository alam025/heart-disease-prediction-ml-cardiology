## üî¨ Clinical Validation Requirements

### For Medical Features

All clinical features must include:

1. **Medical Literature Citation**
   - Peer-reviewed journal reference
   - Clinical study validation
   - Cardiology guidelines confirmation

2. **Statistical Significance**
   - p-value < 0.05
   - Confidence intervals
   - Effect size calculations

3. **Clinical Relevance**
   - Explain medical importance
   - Describe patient impact
   - Justify inclusion criteria

### Example Clinical Contribution

```python
# ‚úÖ GOOD: Clinically validated feature
def calculate_framingham_risk_score(age, cholesterol, hdl, blood_pressure):
    """
    Calculate Framingham Risk Score for cardiovascular disease.
    
    Clinical Validation:
    - Wilson PW, et al. Circulation. 1998;97(18):1837-47.
    - AHA/ACC Guidelines 2019
    - Validated in 5,209 participants over 12 years
    
    Args:
        age (int): Patient age in years
        cholesterol (int): Total cholesterol (mg/dL)
        hdl (int): HDL cholesterol (mg/dL)
        blood_pressure (int): Systolic BP (mmHg)
    
    Returns:
        float: 10-year cardiovascular risk percentage
    """
    # Implementation with clinical validation
    pass
```
